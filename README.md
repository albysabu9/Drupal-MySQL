   # **IIEC Docker Project using drupal and mysql**
This is a multicontainer docker application using drupal and mysql.

## **What is Drupal**

Drupal is a free and open-source content-management framework written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License. It is used as a back-end framework for at least 2.1% of all Web sites worldwide ranging from personal blogs to corporate, political, and government sites including WhiteHouse.gov and data.gov.uk. It is also used for knowledge management and business collaboration.

## **What is MySQL**

MySQL is the world's most popular open source database. With its proven performance, reliability and ease-of-use, MySQL has become the leading database choice for web-based applications, covering the entire range from personal projects and websites, via e-commerce and information services, all the way to high profile web properties including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Yahoo! and many more.

 ### Steps to create this multicontainer application. ###

 ### 1  Prerequisites ###
 - This project is completely done on RHEL(Red Hat Enterprise Linux).
 - Install docker on the os using the cmd `yum install docker`.
 - Install docker-compose using the below cmd:
 
  ` curl â€“L"https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose `


 ### 2  Start the Docker Service ###
 -  Use `systemctl start docker` to start Docker Service.
   
 ### 3  Download the required images: ###
 - Pull MySQL Image: 
 
    Use `docker pull mysql:5.7` to download the mysql version 5.7 image to use as a database server.
 - Pull Drupal Image: 
 
    Use `docker pull drupal:8-apache` to download the drupal Image in which apache server is preconfigured.
